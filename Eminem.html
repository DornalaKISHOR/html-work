      Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally
      as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper.
      He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is often
      regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[3] Eminem's global
      success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial
      barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much
      of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a
      controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of
      the American underclass and has been cited as an influence by and upon
      many artists working in various genres.After the release of his debut
      album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem
      signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved
      mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two
      releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were
      worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album
      of the Year. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem
      went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction.[4]
      He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of
      Relapse (2009) and Recovery, which was released the following year.
      Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's
      second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album
      of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number
      one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze
      (2018), and Music to Be Murdered By (2020). Eminem's songs include "My
      Name Is", "The Real Slim Shady", "The Way I Am", "Stan", "Without Me",
      "Lose Yourself", "Mockingbird", "Not Afraid", "Love the Way You Lie", "Rap
      God", "The Monster", "River" and "Godzilla". In addition to his solo
      career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for
      collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"; the two are
      collectively known as Bad Meets Evil. Eminem starred in the 2002 musical
      drama film 8 Mile, playing a dramatized version of himself. "Lose
      Yourself", a track from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for
      12 weeks, the most for a solo rap song, and won the Academy Award for Best
      Original Song, making Eminem the first hip hop artist ever to win the
      award.[5] He has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001),
      Funny People (2009), and The Interview (2014), and the television series
      Entourage (2010). Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady
      Records, a joint venture with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch
      the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, D12, and Obie Trice, among others.
      He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio.

      given custody of his sister-in-law's daughter,[318] as well as Scott's

      2000s.[322][323] He stated in 2002 that he had been dating singer Mariah
      Carey, though she later denied it. In 2005, he played alleged voicemails
      of her during the Anger Management Tour and stated in 2006 that he had
      dated her for six to seven months, but the two broke up due to the
      differences in their personalities.[324] In early 2010, Eminem denied
      tabloid reports that he and Scott had renewed their romantic relationship;
      however, in the same statement, his representative also confirmed that
      they now maintain a friendly relationship.[325] In his 2013 song
      "Headlights", Eminem reiterated his love for his mother and apologized to
      her for some of the lyrics from his songs, with "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
      being specifically named.[326]

      Eminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs,
      including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium.[327] According to friend and fellow
      D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002.[328] During the
      production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia.
      An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which "knocked [him] out",
      encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first
      experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years.
      Near the end of production on Encore, he would "just go into the studio
      and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills". Eminem began taking the drugs
      to "feel normal", taking a "ridiculous amount ... I could consume anywhere
      from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30." The drugs would put
      him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more.
      Eminem's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg) and he was regularly
      eating fast food: "The kids behind the counter knew me — it wouldn't even
      faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It
      was sad." Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain and once
      overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: "Eminem
      ain't fat".[27]In December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone
      overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was "just
      like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver". He continued to buy more until
      he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital.
      Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of
      heroin and was "about two hours from dying". After missing Christmas with
      his children, Hailie, Alaina and Stevie, Eminem checked himself out of the
      facility, weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee
      after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned
      home, he had a seizure. His drug use "ramped right back to where it was
      before" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get
      clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a
      rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program that emphasized
      running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a
      week to check on him.[27] Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008.[330]

      Dr. Dre (born February 18, 1965, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) American
      rapper, hip-hop producer, and entrepreneur who helped popularize the
      gangsta rap subgenre. Born to teenaged parents who aspired to singing
      careers, André Young took the stage name Dr. Dre in the early 1980s. He
      performed as a hip-hop deejay and as part of the group World Class
      Wreckin’ Cru at clubs and parties in Los Angeles’ south-central district.
      In 1986 he founded N.W.A (Niggaz Wit Attitudes) with fellow rappers Eazy-E
      and Ice Cube. The group’s second album, Straight Outta Compton (1988), was
      a breakthrough for the nascent gangsta rap movement, featuring explicit
      descriptions (and often glorifications) of street violence and drug
      dealing. While Dre appeared prominently as a rapper in N.W.A, his
      most-lauded role was as a producer, crafting ambitiously noisy,
      multilayered sonic collages to back the group’s inflammatory lyrics.
